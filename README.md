# Final Fantasy X Thunder Bolt Dodger

A console application that helps you dodge lightning strikes in the game Final Fintasy X

## Why?

In Final Fantasy X there is a reward and achievement for being able to dodge 200 lightning strikes in a row in the Thunder Plains area. This is tedious and hard work. This tool exists to help those who don't feel like accomplishing the tasks themselves.

## Usage
* Have Final Fantasy X running
* Start the thunder bolt dodger application
* If it's not working properly, try modifying the grayscale threshold in the application configuration file
